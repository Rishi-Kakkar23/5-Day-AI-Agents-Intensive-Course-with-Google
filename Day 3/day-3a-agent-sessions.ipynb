Here are some of the key areas where significant progress is being made:\n\n**1. Deeper Understanding of Disease Biology:**\n\n*   **AI-powered Omics Analysis:** AI is becoming incredibly adept at analyzing vast \"omics\" datasets (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) to uncover the complex molecular underpinnings of diseases. This helps identify novel drug targets that were previously unknown.\n*   **Network Biology and Pathway Analysis:** AI can map out intricate biological networks and pathways, revealing how different molecules interact and how disruptions lead to disease. This allows for more targeted and effective drug development.\n*   **Single-Cell Analysis:** AI is crucial for interpreting the massive datasets generated from single-cell sequencing, providing a granular understanding of cellular heterogeneity within diseases and identifying specific cell types that are key to disease progression or could be therapeutic targets.\n\n**2. Novel AI Architectures and Algorithms for Drug Design:**\n\n*   **Generative AI for Molecule Design:** This is a huge area of advancement. Instead of just screening existing libraries, generative AI models (like GANs and VAEs, and now more sophisticated diffusion models) can *create* entirely new molecules with desired properties. This allows for the design of drugs with specific binding affinities, pharmacokinetic profiles, and reduced toxicity.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning for Optimization:** AI can be trained using reinforcement learning to iteratively refine molecule designs, optimizing them for multiple criteria simultaneously (e.g., potency, selectivity, solubility).\n*   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** GNNs are particularly well-suited for representing and analyzing molecular structures, enabling more accurate prediction of molecular properties and interactions.\n\n**3. Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **AI for Phenotypic Screening:** AI is enhancing phenotypic screening (observing the effect of compounds on cells or organisms) by automatically analyzing complex visual data and identifying promising leads more efficiently.\n*   **Predictive Modeling for Target Druggability:** AI can assess whether a newly identified target is \"druggable\" – meaning a molecule can effectively bind to and modulate its activity.\n\n**4. Enhancing Preclinical and Clinical Development:**\n\n*   **AI for Predicting ADMET Properties:** AI models are getting better at predicting Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties of drug candidates early in the pipeline, reducing the likelihood of late-stage failures.\n*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can identify novel biomarkers from patient data that can predict drug response or disease progression, leading to more personalized treatments and better clinical trial design.\n*   **In Silico Clinical Trials:** While still in early stages, AI is being explored to simulate aspects of clinical trials, potentially reducing the need for some in-vivo testing and accelerating the path to market.\n\n**5. Examples of Recent Breakthroughs and Initiatives:**\n\n*   **Companies like Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia, and Atomwise** are making significant strides using AI to discover and develop novel drugs, with some of their candidates entering clinical trials.\n*   **The use of AI to identify potential treatments for emerging infectious diseases**, such as COVID-19, has been a rapid area of application.\n*   **AI is playing a role in developing treatments for rare diseases** by sifting through vast amounts of genetic and biological data to find potential therapeutic avenues.\n\n**Challenges and the Road Ahead:**\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain:\n\n*   **Data Quality and Accessibility:** High-quality, diverse datasets are crucial for training effective AI models.\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions still need rigorous experimental validation in the lab.\n*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI model makes a certain prediction can still be difficult, which is important for scientific rigor and regulatory approval.\n*   **Regulatory Hurdles:** The regulatory framework for AI-discovered drugs is still evolving.\n\nHowever, the momentum is undeniable. AI is fundamentally changing how we approach drug discovery, making it faster, more efficient, and more likely to yield breakthrough therapies for a wide range of diseases.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the second development I mentioned, which was **\"Novel AI Architectures and Algorithms for Drug Design\"**. This is a really exciting and rapidly evolving area.\n\nLet me elaborate on what that means and why it's so transformative:\n\n**The Traditional Approach vs. AI-Driven Design:**\n\n*   **Traditional Drug Discovery:** Historically, drug discovery often involved a lot of trial and error. Researchers would synthesize or screen large libraries of existing chemical compounds to see if any had the desired biological effect. This was a laborious and often inefficient process.\n*   **AI-Driven Design:** AI is moving beyond just screening. It's about *generating* novel molecular structures that are specifically designed to meet certain criteria. Think of it as AI being an architect that can draw up blueprints for new molecules, rather than just picking from a pre-existing catalog.\n\n**Key AI Technologies Involved:**\n\n*   **Generative AI Models:** This is the cornerstone. These models can learn the underlying patterns and rules of chemistry and molecular structures from vast datasets. Once trained, they can then generate new, never-before-seen molecules that are predicted to have specific properties.\n    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks, a \"generator\" that creates new molecules and a \"discriminator\" that tries to distinguish between real molecules and generated ones. Through this adversarial process, the generator gets better and better at creating realistic and potentially useful molecules.\n    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** VAEs can learn a compressed representation (a \"latent space\") of molecules. By sampling from this latent space, they can generate new molecules.\n    *   **Diffusion Models:** These are a more recent and very powerful class of generative models that are showing tremendous promise in generating highly diverse and novel molecular structures with precise control over desired properties.\n\n*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL can be used to fine-tune the molecules generated by generative models. Imagine the AI designing a molecule. RL can then \"reward\" or \"penalize\" the AI based on how well the molecule meets specific criteria (e.g., how strongly it binds to a target protein, how soluble it is, how low its predicted toxicity is). The AI learns through this feedback loop to optimize the molecule.\n\n*   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Molecules are naturally represented as graphs, where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges. GNNs are AI models specifically designed to process graph-structured data. They are excellent at:\n    *   **Predicting Molecular Properties:** Such as binding affinity, solubility, or reactivity, directly from the molecular structure.\n    *   **Understanding Molecular Interactions:** How a drug molecule might interact with a target protein.\n\n**What This Means in Practice for Drug Discovery:**\n\n1.  **Designing \"From Scratch\":** Instead of screening millions of existing compounds, AI can design entirely new molecules with optimized properties from the ground up. This is like having a personalized suit tailored to fit perfectly, rather than trying to find one off the rack.\n2.  **Exploring Vast Chemical Space:** The number of possible chemical compounds is astronomically large. AI can help explore this vast \"chemical space\" in a much more intelligent and directed way, identifying promising candidates that might otherwise be missed.\n3.  **Optimizing for Multiple Properties Simultaneously:** A good drug isn't just about binding to its target. It also needs to be soluble, absorbable, not too toxic, and metabolize appropriately. AI can be trained to consider and optimize for these multiple, often competing, properties at the same time, which is incredibly difficult for humans to do manually.\n4.  **Discovering Novel Chemical Scaffolds:** AI can lead to the discovery of entirely new classes of molecules (scaffolds) with unique structures that can be further developed into drugs.\n\n**Why is this a \"Development\"?**\n\nThis is a development because:\n\n*   **It's a paradigm shift:** We're moving from searching to creating.\n*   **The algorithms are maturing:** GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models, initially developed for image generation, are being adapted and refined for chemical synthesis.\n*   **The impact is tangible:** Companies are now actively using these generative approaches, and some AI-designed drug candidates are already progressing into clinical trials.\n\nIn essence, these novel AI architectures are providing drug discovery scientists with powerful new tools to design better medicines, faster and more efficiently.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The field of AI-driven drug discovery, particularly involving novel AI architectures for molecule design, is bustling with activity.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
